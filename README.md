## Description

🔍 I've created a real estate application that utilizes React as the frontend framework and Firebase as the online platform for server functions and database management. This application enables users to engage in buying, selling, or renting luxury homes with the added functionality of integrated maps and seamless communication with sellers. It provides a user-friendly platform to fulfill all your real estate requirements.

## ✋User Story

I WANT to create a mobile app that empowers users to buy or rent homes, as well as easily list their own properties for sale or rental,
SO THAT I can streamline the real estate transaction process and provide a convenient platform for individuals to find and manage their housing needs.
